Hi there at Learn Web Three we're building the foundations of this ecosystem and bringing it together to new peaks, you can find (while the organization lift's off) foundational concepts about the technology below this colossal change of our daily lives in how we communicate and exchange ideas.

The ecosystem is still new, the layers are stil being built, brands rise up everyday allowing finance to be decentralized and devoid from previously highly burocratic services.

We aim to share common values and decisions without sacrificing the social aspect
