In this moment of great innovations across the web the most notable standing giant is the Web 3, many speak of it, few dare to question the challenge it solves and the opportunities it brings

## What are tokens ?

Tokens are the main known entity in the web 3 space for representing currency but they are in reality much more than that.
You can assume that the network's so called economy circulates them as their main asset and considers them i the big picture as fungible currencies, gui and gwei, in laymen terms gas to compute the transactions, abstract assets built on top of fungible tokes as non fungible ones, certifications of various nature.

Worry some as it sounds their encoding is a serious second if not third blockchain era application of token standards and this makes them differentiated for all intended purposes.

## What is their usage ?

In practice how you mostly encounter tokes is as non fungible assets and contracts, fungible currencies and communications such as votes and certifications of fulfillment.

## Code wise

You can think of tokens as cryptographic code defined by standards, these standards are a set called ERC for the Ethereum based ones.

Another way of seeing them is as mathematical problems of different nature assigned to mining nodes on participation.

And in more simple terms numbers on a treasury or wallet balance.

## Three ways the network yields tokens

These tokens are generated in may ways across the network and having community values shared together created value generation methods that go beyond what you could achieve by creating self sustaining transactions.

In general terms of network effects you ca describe how the network generated through games pools of tokes with the purpose of putting into circulation liquidity that could attract more games and network participants.

Another front to generate tokes is through the yielding of odes that each epoch generate more tokens in order to continue generating.

On top of these network effects you can trade, buy ad sell different assets both fungible and non or compound with subnets through games and investment yielding.

## How could you get them without owning them?

Tokens can be bought through exchange platforms that possess services like indexes with current and future values of a given network's currency, some of these listings might provide buying options for some of the indexed blockchain networks through fiat currency deposits.

I cases of tokens of networks created on top of other networks as composite but self standing networks it can also provide an intermediary service for converting them.
